## 1. Loan Default Prediction
**Description**: This project focuses on building a predictive model to assess loan default risk. By using classification techniques, we aim to predict whether a loan applicant will default based on various features such as credit score, loan amount, and income.  
**Tools/Techniques**: Python, Scikit-learn, Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
**Objective**: Minimize loan default rates by improving loan approval processes.

## 2. Customer Churn Analysis
**Description**: In this project, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and churn patterns. We analyzed features such as customer tenure, product usage, and service subscriptions to predict which customers are likely to leave.  
**Tools/Techniques**: Python, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Objective**: Improve customer retention through data-driven insights.

## 3. House Price Prediction
**Description**: A regression-based machine learning model was developed to predict house prices based on features like location, square footage, and number of bedrooms. The project focused on building an accurate model using techniques like linear regression and feature engineering.  
**Tools/Techniques**: Python, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Feature Engineering  
**Objective**: Provide accurate house price predictions to assist real estate professionals and buyers.
