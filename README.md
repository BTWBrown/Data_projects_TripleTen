## 1. Megaline Plan Recommendation
**Description**: Megaline, a mobile carrier, is looking to recommend new plans (Smart or Ultra) to their subscribers who are still using legacy plans. The goal of this project is to develop a classification model that analyzes subscribers' behavior and recommends the most suitable plan. The model needs to achieve an accuracy of at least 75% on the test dataset.  
**Tools/Techniques**: Python, Scikit-learn, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression  
**Objective**: Develop a recommendation model with the highest possible accuracy to help Megaline optimize its plan offerings.

## 2. Customer Churn Analysis
**Description**: In this project, we conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior and churn patterns. We analyzed features such as customer tenure, product usage, and service subscriptions to predict which customers are likely to leave.  
**Tools/Techniques**: Python, SQL, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
**Objective**: Improve customer retention through data-driven insights.

## 3. Rusty Bargain Used Car Price Prediction
**Description**: Rusty Bargain, a used car sales service, is developing an app to attract new customers by allowing them to quickly find the market value of their cars. Using historical data on technical specifications, trim versions, and prices, we built a model to predict car values. The project emphasizes prediction quality, speed, and training time.  
**Tools/Techniques**: Python, Scikit-learn, Linear Regression, Random Forest, Model Optimization  
**Objective**: Build an efficient and accurate model to determine the market value of used cars, balancing prediction speed and training time.

## 4. Sales Data Forecasting
**Description**: This project involved forecasting future sales based on historical data. We used time series analysis to forecast sales trends and identify seasonal patterns, providing actionable insights for inventory and production planning.  
**Tools/Techniques**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Time Series Analysis  
**Objective**: Improve sales forecasting accuracy to optimize inventory management and production scheduling.
